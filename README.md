#  Predicting Patient Survival with Random Forests

This repository contains a complete machine learning tutorial demonstrating how to enhance a Random Forest classifier using SMOTE, feature scaling, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The project uses real-world medical data from the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset.

---

##  Project Overview

This tutorial is built for learners aiming to understand:
- How Random Forests work and how to improve them
- Why class imbalance is critical in healthcare
- How to use SMOTE, scaling, and tuning to build better models
- The importance of evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
